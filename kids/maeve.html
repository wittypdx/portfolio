<h1>Kids were playing with the dog</h1>

<h3>By Maeve</h3>

<p>The dogs were very happy, they ran through grass. And they lived on a farm. They liked to play in their doghouse. They explored a little bit. Then they got lost. They ran around barking and some people noticed them. The owners came and found them.</p>

<p>What to do if you find a lost dog</p>
<ol>
	<li>Bring it home</li>
	<li>Help it</li>
	<li>Find its owner</li>
</ol>
