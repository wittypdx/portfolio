<h1>Hybrid Dogs</h1>
<h2>By:Saphina Chisek-Singh</h2>

<h3>Sheepadoodles</h3>



<p>Sheepadoodles are a mixture between sheepdogs and poodles.In my opinion they are perfect for a family.They do not shed a lot,and they enjoy travel.This dog has a very soft coat.Look at it and you will instintly fall in love.Siriously.If you have kids, you shoud consider this dog; they love kids.They are hypoallergenic.</p>

<h2>Puppies</h2>
<p> If you want a puppy,you should do some reaserch.Once you've found a puppy you like,go to pet finder.com to adopt one.If you do not want to adopt one thats fine, but it would be kinder to adopt a puppy.If you have allergies to dogs you should get a hypoallergenic dog.Make sure thats the dog you want.</p>
